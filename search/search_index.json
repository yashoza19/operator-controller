OLM streamlines the process of installing, running, and updating these extensions, making it easier, safer, and more reproducible for cluster and platform administrators alike.</p> <p>Originally, OLM was focused on managing a specific type of extension known as Operators, which are powerful tools that automate the management of complex Kubernetes applications. At its core, an Operator is made up of controllers that automate the lifecycle of applications, paired with:</p> <ul> <li>One or more Kubernetes API extensions.</li> <li>One or more CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), allowing administrators to define custom resources.</li> </ul> <p>The purpose of OLM is to manage the lifecycle of these extensions\u2014from their packaging and distribution to installation, updates, and eventual removal\u2014helping administrators ensure stability and security across their clusters.</p> <p>In its first release (OLM v0), the project introduced several important concepts and features aimed at improving the lifecycle management of Kubernetes applications:</p> <ul> <li>Dependency Model: Enables extensions to focus on their primary function by delegating non-essential tasks to other dependencies.</li> <li>Constraint Model: Allows developers to define compatibility constraints such as conflicting extensions or minimum required Kubernetes versions.</li> <li>Namespace-Based Multi-Tenancy: Provides a multi-tenancy model to manage multiple extensions without the need for namespace-scoped CRDs.</li> <li>Packaging Model: Distributes extensions through catalogs, allowing users to browse and install extensions, often with access to the full version history.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks to these innovations, OLM has played a significant role in popularizing Operators throughout the Kubernetes ecosystem. A prime example of its impact is OperatorHub.io, a widely-used platform with over 300 Operators from various vendors, providing users with a central location to discover and install Operators.</p>"},{"location":"#why-build-olm-v1","title":"Why Build OLM v1?","text":"<p>After five years of real-world use, OLM has become an essential part of managing Kubernetes Operators. However, over time, the community has gathered valuable insights, uncovering both the strengths and limitations of OLM v0. These findings have led to a comprehensive redesign and the creation of OLM v1, with several key improvements over the initial version:</p> <ul> <li>Simpler API and Mental Model: Streamlined APIs and a more intuitive design, making it easier to understand and work with.</li> <li>Greater Flexibility: Less rigid automation, allowing for more customization and broader use cases.</li> <li>Beyond Operators: Support for a wider range of Kubernetes applications, not limited to Operators.</li> <li>Security by Default: Enhanced security features out-of-the-box, reducing vulnerabilities.</li> <li>Helm Chart and GitOps Support: Expanded support for popular Kubernetes tools like Helm and GitOps, broadening the range of integration options.</li> </ul> <p>For more details on the evolution of OLM and the roadmap for v1, explore the following resources:</p> <ul> <li>Multi-Tenancy Challenges, Lessons Learned, and Design Shifts</li> <li>OLM v1 Roadmap</li> </ul>"},{"location":"api-reference/catalogd-api-reference/","title":"API Reference","text":""},{"location":"api-reference/catalogd-api-reference/#packages","title":"Packages","text":"<ul> <li>olm.operatorframework.io/core</li> <li>olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1</li> </ul>"},{"location":"api-reference/catalogd-api-reference/#olmoperatorframeworkiocore","title":"olm.operatorframework.io/core","text":"<p>Package api is the internal version of the API.</p>"},{"location":"api-reference/catalogd-api-reference/#olmoperatorframeworkiov1alpha1","title":"olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1","text":"<p>Package v1alpha1 contains API Schema definitions for the core v1alpha1 API group</p>"},{"location":"api-reference/catalogd-api-reference/#resource-types","title":"Resource Types","text":"<ul> <li>ClusterCatalog</li> <li>ClusterCatalogList</li> </ul>"},{"location":"api-reference/catalogd-api-reference/#catalogsource","title":"CatalogSource","text":"<p>CatalogSource is a discriminated union of possible sources for a Catalog.

When unspecified, the latest version available will be installed.Acceptable version ranges are no longer than 64 characters.Version ranges are composed of comma- or space-delimited values and one ormore comparison operators, known as comparison strings. Additionalcomparison strings can be added using the OR operator (||).# Range ComparisonsTo specify a version range, you can use a comparison string like \"&gt;=3.0,&lt;3.6\". When specifying a range, automatic updates will occur within thatrange. The example comparison string means \"install any version greater thanor equal to 3.0.0 but less than 3.6.0.\". It also states intent that if anyupgrades are available within the version range after initial installation,those upgrades should be automatically performed.# Pinned VersionsTo specify an exact version to install you can use a version range that\"pins\" to a specific version. When pinning to a specific version, noautomatic updates will occur. An example of a pinned version range is\"0.6.0\", which means \"only install version 0.6.0 and neverupgrade from this version\".# Basic Comparison OperatorsThe basic comparison operators and their meanings are:  - \"=\", equal (not aliased to an operator)  - \"!=\", not equal  - \"&lt;\", less than  - \"&gt;\", greater than  - \"&gt;=\", greater than OR equal to  - \"&lt;=\", less than OR equal to# Wildcard ComparisonsYou can use the \"x\", \"X\", and \"\" characters as wildcard characters in allcomparison operations.

In Kubernetes, API registration is cluster-scoped. It is not possible to register different APIs in different namespaces. Instances of an API can be cluster- or namespace-scoped. All APIs are global (they can be invoked/accessed regardless of namespace). For cluster-scoped APIs, the names of their instances must be unique. For example, it\u2019s possible to have Nodes named \u201cone\u201d and \u201ctwo\u201d, but it\u2019s not possible to have multiple Nodes named \u201ctwo\u201d. For namespace-scoped APIs, the names of their instances must be unique per namespace. The following illustrates this for ConfigMaps, a namespace-scoped API:</p> <p>Allowed</p> <ul> <li>Namespace: test, name: my-configmap</li> <li>Namespace: other, name: my-configmap</li> </ul> <p>Disallowed</p> <ul> <li>Namespace: test, name: my-configmap</li> <li>Namespace: test, name: my-configmap</li> </ul> <p>In cases where OLMv0 decides that joint ownership of CRDs will not impact different tenants, OLMv0 allows multiple installations of bundles that include the same named CRD, and OLMv0 itself manages the CRD lifecycle. This has security implications because it requires OLMv0 to act as a deputy, but it also pits OLM against the limitations of the Kubernetes API. OLMv0 promises that different versions of an operator can be installed in the cluster for use by different tenants without tenants being affected by each other. This is not a promise OLM can make because it is not possible to have multiple versions of the same CRD present on a cluster for different tenants.</p> <p>In OLM v1, we will not design the core APIs and controllers around this promise. Instead, we will build an API where ownership of installed objects is not shared. Managed objects are owned by exactly one extension.</p> <p>This pattern is generic, aligns with the Kubernetes API, and makes multi-tenancy a possibility, but not a guarantee or core concept. We will explore the implications of this design on existing OLMv0 registry+v1 bundles as part of the larger v0 to v1 migration design. For net new content, operator authors that intend multiple installations of operator on the same cluster would need to package their components to account for this ownership rule. Generally, this would entail separation along these lines: - CRDs, conversion webhook workloads, and admission webhook configurations and workloads, APIServices and workloads. - Controller workloads, service accounts, RBAC, etc.</p> <p>OLM v1 will include primitives (e.g. templating) to make it possible to have multiple non-conflicting installations of bundles.</p> <p>However, it should be noted that the purpose of these primitives is not to enable multi-tenancy. It is to enable administrators to provide configuration for the installation of an extension. The fact that operators can be packaged as separate bundles and parameterized in a way that permits multiple controller installations is incidental, and not something that OLM v1 will encourage or promote.</p>"},{"location":"project/olmv1_design_decisions/#make-olm-secure-by-default","title":"Make OLM secure by default","text":"<p>OLMv0 runs as cluster-admin, which is a security concern. OLMv0 has optional security controls for operator installations via the OperatorGroup, which allows a user with permission to create or update them to also set a ServiceAccount that will be used for authorization purposes on operator installations and upgrades in that namespace. If a ServiceAccount is not explicitly specified, OLM\u2019s cluster-admin credentials are used. Another avenue that cluster administrators have is to lock down permissions and usage of the CatalogSource API, disable default catalogs, and provide tenants with custom vetted catalogs. However if a cluster admin is not aware of these options, the default configuration of a cluster results in users with permission to create a Subscription in namespaces that contain an OperatorGroup effectively have cluster-admin, because OLMv0 has unlimited permissions to install any bundle available in the default catalogs and the default community catalog is not vetted for limited RBAC. Because OLMv0 is used to install more RBAC and run arbitrary workloads, there are numerous potential vectors that attackers could exploit.

For example, the first extension that matches might install successfully and finish without searching for a match in the second catalog.</p> </li> <li> <p>Apply the CR to the cluster:</p> <pre><code>kubectl apply -f &lt;cr_name&gt;.yaml\n</code></pre> Success Example output<pre><code>clusterextension.olm.operatorframework.io/camel-k created\n</code></pre> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"tutorials/install-extension/#verification","title":"Verification","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Describe the installed extension:</p> <pre><code>kubectl describe clusterextensions\n</code></pre> Success Example output<pre><code>Name:         argocd\nNamespace:\nLabels:       &lt;none&gt;\nAnnotations:  &lt;none&gt;\nAPI Version:  olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1\nKind:         ClusterExtension\nMetadata:\nCreation Timestamp:  2024-10-03T16:02:40Z\nFinalizers:\n    olm.operatorframework.io/cleanup-unpack-cache\n    olm.operatorframework.io/cleanup-contentmanager-cache\nGeneration:        2\nResource Version:  1174\nUID:               0fcaf3f5-d142-4c7e-8d88-c88a549f7764\nSpec:\nInstall:\n    Namespace:  argocd\n    Service Account:\n    Name:  argocd-installer\nSource:\n    Catalog:\n    Package Name:  argocd-operator\n    Selector:\n    Upgrade Constraint Policy:  CatalogProvided\n    Version:                    0.6.0\n    Source Type:                  Catalog\nStatus:\nConditions:\n    Last Transition Time:  2024-10-03T16:02:41Z\n    Message:\n    Observed Generation:   2\n    Reason:                Deprecated\n    Status:                False\n    Type:                  Deprecated\n    Last Transition Time:  2024-10-03T16:02:41Z\n    Message:\n    Observed Generation:   2\n    Reason:                Deprecated\n    Status:                False\n    Type:                  PackageDeprecated\n    Last Transition Time:  2024-10-03T16:02:41Z\n    Message:\n    Observed Generation:   2\n    Reason:                Deprecated\n    Status:                False\n    Type:                  ChannelDeprecated\n    Last Transition Time:  2024-10-03T16:02:41Z\n    Message:\n    Observed Generation:   2\n    Reason:                Deprecated\n    Status:                False\n    Type:                  BundleDeprecated\n    Last Transition Time:  2024-10-03T16:02:43Z\n    Message:               Installed bundle quay.io/operatorhubio/argocd-operator@sha256:d538c45a813b38ef0e44f40d279dc2653f97ca901fb660da5d7fe499d51ad3b3 successfully\n    Observed Generation:   2\n    Reason:                Succeeded\n    Status:                True\n    Type:                  Installed\n    Last Transition Time:  2024-10-03T16:02:43Z\n    Message:               desired state reached\n    Observed Generation:   2\n    Reason:                Succeeded\n    Status:                False\n    Type:                  Progressing\nInstall:\n    Bundle:\n    Name:     argocd-operator.v0.6.0\n    Version:  0.6.0\nEvents:         &lt;none&gt;\n</code></pre> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/uninstall-extension/","title":"Uninstall an extension","text":"<p>You can uninstall a Kubernetes extension and its associated custom resource definitions (CRD) by deleting the extension's custom resource (CR).</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/uninstall-extension/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<ul> <li>You have an extension installed.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/uninstall-extension/#procedure","title":"Procedure","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Delete the extension's CR:</p> <pre><code>kubectl delete clusterextensions &lt;extension_name&gt;\n</code></pre> <code>extension_name</code> Specifies the name defined in the <code>metadata.name</code> field of the extension's CR.
